## Q0.1.1
- Critical Aspect and Reasoning 1
- Bandwidth Determination

From the signals presented in Figure 5 and Figure 6, we can determine the bandwidths as follows:

### Message Signal Bandwidth

Formula: 

$$
\beta = f_{\text{max}} - f_{\text{min}}
$$

Calculation: For a signal with frequency $f = 50$ Hz, the bandwidth is: 

$$
\beta_{\text{message}} = 50 - (-50) = 100 \text{ Hz}
$$

### Double Sideband (DSB) Modulated Signal Bandwidth

Calculation: DSB modulation transmits both upper and lower sidebands, so the bandwidth is: 

$$
\beta_{\text{DSB}} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ Hz}
$$

### Single Sideband (SSB) Modulated Signal Bandwidth

Calculation: SSB modulation transmits only one sideband, so the bandwidth is: 

$$
\beta_{\text{SSB}} = 50 \text{ Hz}
$$

## Q0.1.1
- Critical Reasoning:
- Opinion on Power and Bandwidth Content

The modulation process has a significant impact on both power and bandwidth content associated with the message signal.

### Double Sideband (DSB) Modulation

**Bandwidth:** The bandwidth of the DSB modulated signal is twice the bandwidth of the original message signal because DSB modulation transmits both the upper and lower sidebands.

**Power Consumption:** Higher in DSB modulation because both sidebands are transmitted, requiring more power.

### Single Sideband (SSB) Modulation

**Bandwidth:** The bandwidth of the SSB modulated signal is equal to the bandwidth of the original message signal because SSB modulation transmits only one sideband, effectively halving the bandwidth compared to DSB.

**Power Consumption:** Lower in SSB modulation because only one sideband is transmitted, requiring less power.
